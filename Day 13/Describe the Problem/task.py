# Describe the Problem - Write your answers as comments:
# 1. What is the for loop doing? loop is picking a numbers that are between 1 and 20 but not equal to 20
# 2. When is the function meant to print "You got it"? then print :You got it" only when I is equal to 20
# 3. What are your assumptions about the value of i? That it's between 1 and 20 but not equal to 20
